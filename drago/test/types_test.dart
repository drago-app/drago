          "I hope this is true, but I try not to focus on it.\n\n\nIt’s not healthy to defer all your expectations and put them on some hypothetical future version of your child, who will say “I see now that you were doing what was best. I see now that Mom was stopping you from being there more. I see now that you were right.” I mean, do you know many of your friends who say that to their parents? Does that even sound realistic or good?\n\n\nI try to do what I can do because I can do it. I love my kids. Their mother blocks a lot of what I try to do, and sets it up so that they might blame me, or blame themselves. I work to make good things happen, AND I accept that they might come out of it blaming me equally, or blaming me primarily, especially because it’s safer to blame me——I don’t hold people emotionally hostage, but their mother does. \n\n\nMy kids don’t owe me anything, not even understanding and gratitude in the future. And so I don’t think about it. I do what needs to be , because I’m the Dad, And I’m going to be the best Dad I can be. That’s the end of it.\n\n\nEDIT: folks are commenting that offspring DO tell their parents “I know you’re the good one” or “I now understand that you did what was right”.\n\n\nI believe you. \n\n\nI’m not saying it doesn’t happen. I’m saying you should learn to live without expectation.

          "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this is true, but I try not to focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s not healthy to defer all your expectations and put them on some hypothetical future version of your child, who will say “I see now that you were doing what was best. I see now that Mom was stopping you from being there more. I see now that you were right.” I mean, do you know many of your friends who say that to their parents? Does that even sound realistic or good?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to do what I can do because I can do it. I love my kids. Their mother blocks a lot of what I try to do, and sets it up so that they might blame me, or blame themselves. I work to make good things happen, AND I accept that they might come out of it blaming me equally, or blaming me primarily, especially because it’s safer to blame me——I don’t hold people emotionally hostage, but their mother does. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My kids don’t owe me anything, not even understanding and gratitude in the future. And so I don’t think about it. I do what needs to be , because I’m the Dad, And I’m going to be the best Dad I can be. That’s the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: folks are commenting that offspring DO tell their parents “I know you’re the good one” or “I now understand that you did what was right”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying it doesn’t happen. I’m saying you should learn to live without expectation. It makes your fulfillment conditional, and sets you up for a bad dynamic—-I did XYZ, so my child owes me to speak on it, recognize it, give me my  pay off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They do not, and if they don’t, now you’re resentful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some other places this pops up: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll lose weight and then I’ll get X girl. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll give money to this homeless guy and he’ll clean up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll be a good Christian and then God will bless me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lose weight because you want to be healthier, fitter, better.

Constantly being told that you wouldn't see your daughter because you wanted to escape an abusive relationship, and then when you finally have enough of the verbal, physical and emotional abuse, the narrative was flipped, and your name was dragged through hell the dirt, to make it seem like you've abandoned the family, and for that reason you dont deserve to be a father. \n\n\nLong story short ive waited patiently these last two years, I've not told my side of the story. I said ill play checkers not chess, and ill get my chance to show and prove. 24 hours from today is the single biggest day in my life. They are making a judgement on  who is the better fit parent for custody purposes. I've spent the last two years prepping for my daughters life and future. 529 college accounts, savings accounts when she gets older, getting her a house in one of the best neighborhoods in my city because i need her safe, getting her through trauma therapy because she has 2 separate patents. Working to be the best me thst she sees and influenced by. And so much more.\n\n\nHer mother in the last two years has focused on only herself, her needs and interests, and career. Which her career isnt a bad thing to worry about, but when you become oblivious to your daughters needs and wants its a problem. When you put your boyfriends needs and wants over hers, its a problem. When you put her in a situation where she has to live with someone that has a violent criminal history,  thats a problem.\n\nWhen you have your whole household being investigated because your boyfriend is accused of molesting his daughters and you, a.) Dont tell the father of your child, and divert cps from telling him by giving different numbers and addresses because you \"didnt want him to go do something that would keep the child away\" for her safety, thats a huge problem \n\nWhen you take said boyfriends side, and allow him to remain in your house for months while hes being investigated and still but your love interests over your daughter's. You dont deserve to be a mother.\n Especially since hes finally being labeled a child sex offender \n(And as of last week, charges are being processed against him and he will be pressed while hes in jail for probation violation) \n\nSo here i am, 24 hours away from the biggest day in my life, theres way more to the story, but in all im scared. Im nervous,  im worried. I just want her safe. I just want her happy. I just want her loved. And i just want her home.... with me. The mediator. My lawyer, my doctors, her therapist, children and youth, the advocacy center, all feel as if the case is in my favor, but its still the level of uncertainty. The fact that the weight on my shoulders will be gone in 24 hours, my heart will be complete again,and my life will be forever changed for the better. But that tweet will always sit in the back of my mind until she can comprehend. I wont bash her mother, i wont say anything in a negative light. But all i can do is this, the day she comes to me and asks. I have 5 3 inch bimders. With every text, call, chat, photo, incidents between court and outside of court, and everything else in between. I can hand them to her and let her make her own judgment, and i cant bash her for her decisions. Or bias her into msking one. But i hope in those pages she sees that shes worth more than anything to me. That ill fight to the death for her, and that i went to hell and back to do anything for her. Because she is my lifeline, my heart and soul.... she is me\n\n\nEdit: i keep getting notifications for replies but when i click on it nothing pops up, and when i view on the thread as well nothing pops up. Im on the app, so if anyone knows whats wrong and could help. Please message me, because i dont want people to think im a dick for not responding.",

          "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really hope so because my daughters mother has made me the villain of her story and it isn&amp;#39;t fair. Constantly being told that you wouldn&amp;#39;t see your daughter because you wanted to escape an abusive relationship, and then when you finally have enough of the verbal, physical and emotional abuse, the narrative was flipped, and your name was dragged through hell the dirt, to make it seem like you&amp;#39;ve abandoned the family, and for that reason you dont deserve to be a father. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short ive waited patiently these last two years, I&amp;#39;ve not told my side of the story. I said ill play checkers not chess, and ill get my chance to show and prove. 24 hours from today is the single biggest day in my life. They are making a judgement on  who is the better fit parent for custody purposes. I&amp;#39;ve spent the last two years prepping for my daughters life and future. 529 college accounts, savings accounts when she gets older, getting her a house in one of the best neighborhoods in my city because i need her safe, getting her through trauma therapy because she has 2 separate patents. Working to be the best me thst she sees and influenced by. And so much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her mother in the last two years has focused on only herself, her needs and interests, and career. Which her career isnt a bad thing to worry about, but when you become oblivious to your daughters needs and wants its a problem. When you put your boyfriends needs and wants over hers, its a problem. When you put her in a situation where she has to live with someone that has a violent criminal history,  thats a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you have your whole household being investigated because your boyfriend is accused of molesting his daughters and you, a.)

          "That parent for me was my mother...who I haven't spoken to in 21 years.

I didn't find out the truth until my father had literally weeks left to live. Terminal colon cancer. He laid everything on the table. He didn't leave, she kicked him out of her life because he wasn't ready to marry. He was a Marine, and constantly on deployment. He didn't want to put that life on her...but she didn't see it that way. So she went to the courts and denied him any paternal rights. Because was often out of the country, he couldn't fight it.\n\nI got spend the last 4 weeks of my father's life by his side. 4 weeks out of at that point 20 years I'd been robbed of having him. When he passed, I confronted her about it. Her reaction? She just shrugged. \"If he truly wanted to be in your lives, he'da fought for you.\" Those words resonate in my head to this day. It's that moment my mother died to me as well. Weeks later, I enlisted into the USMC in honor of my father. 3 months later, I left for Paris Island, and never looked back.\n\nI served for 14 years. I married, had a kid and all kinds of other things. I've told my now 20 year old daughter why she's never met her paternal grandmother, and she's ok with it. Her words exactly were \"I'd never want to meet someone who could do that to their own kids.\" There will never be a reconciliation. I have zero contact with her...and that will never change. She'll go to her grave...if she isn't there already miserable and alone.",

Sometimes they need to know that when you leave the mother, you can’t be there as much now if you stay in the same city and not make an effort, you're a horrible father, period. If your a mother who stops the father's effort or complains about something, you are the problem, period. I see some people are broken; stop looking to your country ass dad/mom, who was barely taught how to talk about feelings for closure and repair. They have so much fucked up stuff with themselves they can’t possibly heal shit, find a therapist put that hurt behind you, and live your life beautifully.",
